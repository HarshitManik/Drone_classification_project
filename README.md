# Drone_classification_project
Bringing novelty in earlier drone classification mechanism by introducing different neural networks for inreased  accuracy, using limitied radar data for classification, converting raw radar signals to spectogram data, applying fast fourier transforms and doing feature extraction and also working real-time classification on drones.
