# Drone_classification_project
Bringing novelty in earlier drone classification mechanism by introducing different neural networks for inreased  accuracy, using limitied radar data for classification, converting raw radar signals to spectogram data, applying fast fourier transforms and doing feature extraction and also working real-time classification on drones.

# Spectrogram-Based CNN Classification

## Overview
This project converts `.mat` files containing raw audio data into spectrogram images and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify different flying objects based on their acoustic signatures.

## Procedure
### 1. Convert `.mat` Files to Spectrogram Images
- Load `.mat` files and extract the `rawdata` key.
- Convert the extracted audio data into a floating-point format.
- Generate spectrogram images using `matplotlib`.
- Save valid spectrogram images in separate class-wise folders.
- Log any `.mat` files that were skipped due to missing or invalid data.

### 2. Train a CNN Model for Classification
- Load the spectrogram images and split them into training and validation sets.
- Apply data augmentation techniques for better generalization.
- Define a CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- Compile and train the model using a suitable optimizer and loss function.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, loss curves, and a confusion matrix.

### 3. Generate Confusion Matrix
- Compare predicted vs. actual class labels.
- Plot a heatmap using `seaborn` to visualize misclassifications.
- Print the classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- Successfully processed **1140** spectrogram images from valid `.mat` files.
- Identified and handled **skipped** files due to missing or incompatible data.
- Achieved classification results with CNN.
